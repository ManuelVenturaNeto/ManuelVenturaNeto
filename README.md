# ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Welcome to my Github profile.

## My name is Manuel Ventura!

<p>I'm a student of Control and Automation Engineering at PUC-MG and a mechanical technician at CEFET-MG. I have had a career of over 7 years as an automotive line designer and robot programmer in the automotive segment.
  
I am in a career transition from senior designer/programmer of automotive cells to Python developer, providing solutions and automations with quality to the market.

I believe we have no limits to knowledge. I like to know different areas, activities, and processes in depth, which motivates me to go deeper into the studies that fascinate me the most and expand my horizons. </p>
